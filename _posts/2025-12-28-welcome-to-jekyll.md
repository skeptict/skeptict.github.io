I've converted my site to use Jekyll! This makes it much easier to write and manage blog posts.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that's built into GitHub Pages. It lets you write posts in Markdown and automatically generates a beautiful website.

## How to Add New Posts

Creating a new post is simple:

1. Create a new file in the `_posts/` directory
2. Name it with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Add front matter (the stuff between the `---` marks)
4. Write your post in Markdown
5. Commit and push to GitHub

That's it! GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your updated site.
