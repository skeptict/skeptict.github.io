As a non-coder, Claude Code has been a real mixed bag. 
I mean, it is very cool, I was able to finally put together a Jekyll blog on GitHub pretty painlessly. [https://skeptict.github.io/](https://skeptict.github.io/ "https://skeptict.github.io/") - still a work in progress, but pretty easy to pull off. 
So then I figured, if I give Claude access to the relevant GitHub Draw Things repos I should be able to whip up a DT client, right? I've had it working on a client that uses Ollama to improve prompts, then send them to DT via gRPC. 
I've pretty much used up a week's worth of Claude tokens (I got the Claude Pro subscription) with, frankly, not that much to show for it. 
I get it, I'm like LouieCK's joke about complaining about the spotty wifi on an airplane; the fact that this almost works at all is amazing. But at the end of the day, I used up a ton of LLM tokens and don't have much to show for it. 
Anyway, anyone else here using Claude Code? Got any tricks or tips?
